/**
 * (Perfect number) A positive integer is called a perfect number if it is 
 * equal to the sum of all of its positive divisors, excluding itself. 
 * For example, 6 is the first perfect number because 6 = 3 + 2 + 1. 
 * The next is 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 1. There are four perfect 
 * numbers <10,000. Write a program to find all these four numbers. 
 * Find all perfect numbers less than 1000
